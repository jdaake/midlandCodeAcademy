## It's time to build an adventure game with a magic compass.
* You have a user that will start at a set point in a grid. This starting point can be 0,0 or any random number in the boundary
* That grid can be from -50,-50 all the way up to 50,50
* There will be an objective they have to get to at a different random point.
* The user is presented with options to go North South East or West (cardinal directions only)
* When they move their magical map tells them how far away they are from the destination. (they get that information at start and each move)
* When they reach the destination they win!

BONUS:
* Add a user interface with jQuery to show options, have controls, and have the distance shown to them on move.
* Have a set number of moves that they must complete the trip by (have it be feasibly regardless of distance)
