## Important Reference
* [Status Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes)
* HTTP Verbs Think of CRUD
    * POST/PUT (Create) - if you're logging in to a site or signing up for something that is almost always a POST request
    * GET (Read) generic calls are a simple GET call. Any normal page load is considered a GET request
    * POST/PATCH (Update) - Anytime you're actually changing information to a database such as changing your address or password etc.
    * POST/DELET(Delete) - Removal of information from a database such as account deletion etc.
* [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is GREAT for playing around with random POST and GET requests.
* [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) - Useful for testing things with javascript for XHR requests
* [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) file type. Important for using information with some databases but the bread and butter of javascript communication with servers.
* [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/) - Easy way to see if you have a JSON file that is a proper format.
