# Final Project

## Index Page

This section of the final will be the first of the two most HTML/CSS intensive. Luckily, we're going to make heavy use of the Bootstrap library (which will require us to properly read their documentation).

### Expectations
* The index page should include 3 main parts: 
  1. Your company's logo should be prominent at the top of the screen and be a prominent size without taking up too much of the vertical space. 
  2.  Carousel should have 3 images, with `indicators` and `controls`.
      * Check [this](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/) out for more detail on how to use carousels.
      * Remember, no placeholder images. Go find some images that have to do with your purpose and use those. Have fun with it!
  3.  A 3-column section (on a standard size screen) that should use the bootstrap grid and change width responsively.
      * There is an example of the 3-column layout on the [documentation site](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) for the grid that you can steal.
      * Include some text in each column about your product/service.
      * Make sure that the columns have flex capabilites so they remain the same height regardless of content length.
