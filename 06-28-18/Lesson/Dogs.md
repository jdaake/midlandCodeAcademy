## We're Going to Build a Searchable Dog Database

* Have a dropdown that allows for users to select a specific dog breed.
    * Separate out sub breeds into optgroups of the drop down.
* Whenever a user changes to a new dog breed (or clicks a button, your choice) have a random picture of that breed appear.
* Below the picture, have a button that says something akin to "Show all Images". 
    * When that is clicked hide or remove the random image and the button for "Show all"
    * Take all the images for that specific breed and show them with a button for "Hide All" which when clicked only shows a single image with the "Show All" Button.
* Don't worry too much about styling at the moment. We'll revist this on Tuesday for styling options.
