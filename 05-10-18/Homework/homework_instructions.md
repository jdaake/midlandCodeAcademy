# Homework from 5-10-18


## About Page
Update the about page you built in class (example source [here](https://github.com/miketruax/MidlandCodeAcademy/blob/master/5-9-18/Solution/BasicAboutPageSolution.html) if you didn't save it) to include information about yourself (can be real or fake as you prefer).


----
### Additional Changes
1. Add two links at the top in a nav tag.
2. The links ( a tags ) should be named "Skills and Availability" and "News and Updates" 
3. Make the back to top link go to the links instead of the h1 tag it's currently attached to.
4. If they aren't already, ensure all items that go together are inside their own <div> tags.
5. Remove the section with "send all inquiries" at the bottom


## Skills and Availability Page
Update the skills and availability page you built for class on 5-10-18 to include any extra information about your actual skills.

### Additional Changes
1. Add two links at the top in a nav tag.
2. The links should read "About Me" and "News and Updates"
3. Make a "back to top" link at the bottom that brings you to the nav tag at the top.
4. If they aren't already, ensure all items that go together are inside their own <div> tags.



## News and Updates Page

Build a news and updates page to look similar to the image in this same folder. 
Change the information to anything that you see fit, real or fake. 
Ensure you use at LEAST one strong, and one em tag appropriately. Each section should have at least two paragraphs separated appropriately.
Feel free to use [Lorem ipsum generator](https://www.lipsum.com/) for the text. This isn't an english class I'm not going to make you write out 10 paragraphs.

## ALL PAGES
1. Have all three files in the same folder.
2. Have the links in the <nav> tags point to and open the appropriate files ("About Me" should open the about me page you built etc.)
3. Add the same image to all three pages in the footer as well as a simple note such as "Designed by your name".

### THIS SHOULD BE COMPLETED BEFORE CLASS ON 5-15. If you run into issues reach out via slack.


###BONUS
Create a blank css file named styles.css and link it in the head of each page using the <link> tag. Review the material from day one or the MDN docs if needed.
Create a blank javascript file named example.js and link it to each page using the <script> tag at the bottom of the page right before you close the <body> tag.
In the news and updates page, have two buttons: One should have the words "Subscribe" with the other having the words "Like". These won't do anything yet. and don't appear in the example image.
