##Build the site based off the mockup image attached 

###Required Steps:
 * Utilize File (fullSizeMockup.png) for all styling choices with the page.
 * The menu should be fixed to the top as you scroll through the page.
 * All classes and styles should be built for re-usability where possible and following DRY practices.
 * If you feel you want more practice with HTML build the site from scratch including all HTML
 * If you use the pre made HTML template, fill in comments with required information.
 * The links don't have to go anywhere but should be styled to allow different appearance for on hover and one should be "active" and have different styling as appropriate.
 * Colors can be as those provided in the mock-up or colors you pick.
 * The Footer should have a background image
 * The h1-h6 tags should have a different font from the rest of the text.
 
 
 ###Bonus Steps (recommended for practice)
 * Put in a media query to allow for the page to be displayed differently at smaller resolutions (use 800px as a breakpoint)
 * Follow smallSizeMockup.png for how it should look at smaller resolutions.
 * Make the footer background image have an opacity of .5 but keep the text inside the footer at an opacity of 1.
 * Utilize the google fonts api for h1-h6 fonts
