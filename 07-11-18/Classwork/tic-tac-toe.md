## Tic-Tac-Toe Game
#### Games are a good exercise as you know what it's supposed to do and can tell immediately if it's working or not.

### Minimum requirements:
* Show which player's turn it is
* Allow a box to be selected if it's empty but not if it isn't empty.
* On a valid move, fill the box with the appropriate symbol (X, or O)
* After each move, verify if the move ends the game.
* On game end, show who the winner is or that it ended in a tie.

### Tier 2 Requirements:
* Allow the users to enter their names and display them in lieu of just a symbol
* When a user mouses over a valid move, have that box have a sillouhette of the active player's symbol.
* Remember every move made and have the ability to revert to an earlier stage in the game.

### Tier 3 Requirements: 
* Add the option to play against a computer or a person.
* Add an AI for competition against the user in which the AI moves to the best possible move.


### Notes:
* There are plenty of tutorials and examples out there for tic-tac-toe in multiple languages. DON'T use any of them for reference. This is about how you can approach it.
* When working through the steps, think about how your plans now might have to change for future requirements and adjust accordingly.
* Work together on this as it's not just about how much one person can do. Conversely if the group comes up with a solution that you don't understand or feel isn't the right approach, speak up!
