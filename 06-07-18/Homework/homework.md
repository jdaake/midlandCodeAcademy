##Write the following functions:

* Pass a number into a function that will return the absolute value of that number (absolute value of -1 is 1 and abs of 1 is 1) without the use of built in math functions.
* Make a function called pow that accepts arguments x and y and returns the value of x to the y power
* Write a function that checks to see if the word as an argument is a palindrome (case insensitive) and log the result to the console.
* Write a function that accepts an array of banned words and an array of words. If any of the banned words appear in the array of words (case sensitive), replace them with "REDACTED", do this without any prototypical functions
* Write a function that accepts two arguments (names can be changed):a and b. Cycle through all numbers between a and b (inclusive) and if the number is divisible by 2 log "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3 log "Buzz" if it is divisible by both log "FizzBuzz" otherwise log the number. if a==b log nothing, if b > a count down otherwise count up

##BONUS: 
Use recursion for function 2
##EXTRA BONUS: 
Write a function that contains a function scope variable named counter with a starting value of 0.
   The function should return a closure that when called will increment the counter variable by 1 and log it to the console.
   Assign the function to a variable named counterLog to be able to test it.
