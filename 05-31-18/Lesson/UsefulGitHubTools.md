##General Tips
* Commit Related Changes - A commit should be a wrapper for related changes. 
* Commit Often - Keeping your commits small makes it easier to keep track for you and your coworkers
* Donâ€™t Commit Half-Done Work - Break up work into small logical chunks and commit those
* Test Before You Commit - Make sure it works before pushing it to a repo otherwise you can run into problems down the line.
* Write Good Commit Messages - Shorty summaries help everyone understand the push
* Version Control is not a Backup System - Don't use it like one!
* Use Branches - Branches are your friend. Treat master like a finished product and use branches often.
