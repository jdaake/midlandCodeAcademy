(if you want more practice with linkning inside a page, have a link at the top that goes directly to the form below)

Build a Page with a table listing at least 5 of your skills (real or made up)
(if you want more practice, have each of these link to a website)
in a table with your current proficiency level. Can be vertical or
horizontal whichever you'd prefer

Below that table have a separate table listing your current availability, Sunday-Saturday morning, afternoon, and evening.
Have the cells span multiple rows or columns depending on availability with both a legend at the top and left

Below that, have a form to allow for clients to contact you. Have a name, email, type of work required (select box: "Full Time", "Part Time", "Contract",
 "Contract to Hire") All items should have labels and the two text fields should have placeholders.
 preference for contact time (radio Morning Afternoon Evening) and what technologies they'd like to use (checkboxes at least 4).

ADD THIS TO INSIDE THE <head> tag:
<style>th, td:not(:empty){border: 1px solid black; text-align: center; } </style>

BONUS: Add an audio clip (with controls) on the page as an introduction. This can be a recorded audio or a link to a random file.
In the form, Start with "Evening" and "Contract" selected in the appropriate fields.
